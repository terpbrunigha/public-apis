How to use Robin Murphy Repertory
 
Robin Murphy Repertory is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive. However, it is important to follow some basic guidelines and principles when using it. Here are some tips on how to use the repertory effectively:

- Before consulting the repertory, take a detailed case history of the patient and note down the most characteristic and peculiar symptoms. These are the key to finding the similimum, or the most suitable remedy.
- Use the index or the table of contents to find the relevant chapter and section for the symptom. For example, if the symptom is headache, look for it in the chapter on Head.
- Within each chapter, the rubrics are arranged alphabetically. Look for the rubric that matches the symptom as closely as possible. For example, if the headache is worse from noise, look for Headache, noise, aggravates.
- If the exact rubric is not found, look for synonyms or related terms. For example, if the headache is worse from music, look for Headache, sound, aggravates.
- If the symptom has more than one modality or concomitant, look for sub-rubrics that specify them. For example, if the headache is worse from noise and better from pressure, look for Headache, noise, aggravates; pressure ameliorates.
- If the symptom is very general or vague, look for more specific or qualifying rubrics. For example, if the symptom is pain in the abdomen, look for more details such as location, type, intensity, duration and cause of pain.
- The remedies are listed under each rubric according to their grade or value. The grade indicates the frequency and reliability of the remedy for that symptom. The higher the grade, the more important the remedy. The grades are denoted by different symbols: bold capitals (A), bold italics (B), plain capitals (C), plain italics (D) and plain lower case (E).
- Select a few remedies that cover most of the symptoms and have a high grade. Compare them with each other and with the materia medica to find the most similar remedy. Consider also the general characteristics and constitution of the patient.
- Prescribe the remedy in a suitable potency and dosage according to the principles of homeopathy. Observe and evaluate the response of the patient and adjust accordingly.

Robin Murphy Repertory is a comprehensive and reliable repertory that can help you find the best homeopathic remedy for your patient. However, it is not a substitute for clinical judgment and experience. You should always use your own observation and reasoning skills to confirm your prescription and follow up with your patient.
